     <p>One of my earliest internet memories was a computer class that I had when I was in elementary school.
        The Microsoft paint was one of my favorites. I have been interested in art since I was a child.I thought it was so much fun, I did not have to use color pencils and I can draw a beautiful piece of art on the computer.
        Maybe that experience contributed to why I want to become a graphic designer now.
