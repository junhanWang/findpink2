     <p> One of my earliest internet memories was when I was just 10 years old. Internet was a completely new idea and concept at the time;
       It was during my graduation of my primary school, I spent a lot of free time to explore this whole new thing,I started using “BAIDU” ,
       a Chinese search engine to gather images of my favorite celebrities back then, and used the images to create PowerPoint ( just for fun)
