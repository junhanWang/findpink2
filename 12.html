     <p>Internet, today, has a massive role in everybodyâ€™s life and indeed, it has affected me in the understanding of net art.
        For physical entities like art, net art creates a different world of artistic collections; the audience can reach and enjoy.
        The modern technology has created such a large impact on art that the Internet has given birth to new digital art forms and artists.
        We cannot run from technology, it will be around forever. </p>
